# 02-CSS-Bootstrap

                        **IN PROGRESS** :sweat_smile:  


## Description 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
